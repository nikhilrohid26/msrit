•	Write Pig Latin scripts for Crop Production Dataset. 
crop_prod = LOAD 'Datasets/crop_production.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (State_Name:chararray, District_Name:chararray, Crop_Year:int, Season:chararray, Crop:chararray, Area:float, Production:float);
DESCRIBE crop_prod;

a. Calculate total production of each crop. 
total_production = GROUP crop_prod BY Crop;
sum_production = FOREACH total_production GENERATE group AS Crop, SUM(crop_prod.Production) AS Total_Production;
DUMP sum_production;

b. Find the average production per year for each crop. 
grouped_by_crop_year = GROUP crop_prod BY (Crop, Crop_Year);
average_production = FOREACH grouped_by_crop_year GENERATE group.Crop AS Crop, group.Crop_Year AS Crop_Year, AVG(crop_prod.Production) AS Avg_Production;
DUMP average_production;

c. Filter all crops grown in ‘Karnataka’ 
specific_state = FILTER crop_prod BY State_Name == 'Karnataka';
unique_crops = GROUP specific_state BY Crop;
DUMP unique_crops;

d. Calculate the total area used for each crop in the year 2010. 
specific_year = FILTER crop_prod BY Crop_Year == 2010;
total_area = GROUP specific_year BY Crop;
sum_area = FOREACH total_area GENERATE group AS Crop, SUM(specific_year.Area) AS Total_Area;
DUMP sum_area;
